					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is color acessibiliy and the legal requirements
								surrounding it. I don't know much about color acessibility in general, but on top of that
								I had never considered how websites and screens impact people with color acessibility issues.
								Contrast, iconography, patterns-- I had never considered these to have as strong visual
								impact as colors, but seeing their mention in the article made me reconsider. Therefore, 
								this article taught me ways to not only address the issue but also more about 
								an acessibility problem I wasn't aware of. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> As mentioned above, I had never really thought about the visiability of texture and pattern 
								on screen, mostly since color is how I differentiate between items on screen. Therefore,
								my favorite part of this article was the section titled "Don’t rely solely on color" and
								the illustrative examples included as part of that text. It made me reconsider the purpose of 
								different graphics (beyond colors) that I had seen in the past. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "we have the power to create a web we’re all proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people...
								Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
