                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article is the difference in designing for screen sizes. Although I noticed that
                                apps on phones versus on computers were different, comparing designs that I saw in the article made me realize
                                how dramatic the impact of screen size was on designs. For one, websites ment to be used on apps or phone were
                                both a lot more interactive and compact, with a lot more animation and pop-ups/pages. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is how the user experience is annimated. On phone-screen designs, there is a little
                                circle to indicate where the user is clicking and how the screen would respond to that theoretical input, and there is
                                a mouse on computer-screen designs flipping between pages. Because the different pages are annimated, the article
                                makes it easy to compare how different design choices affect the way users interact with a page.  
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiritations were the "Dark Netflix" design and the easygrow.io app preview. Firstly, the Neflix design
                                is interesting because it simplifies the screen into what is important for viewers to know about the show/series (seasons released,
                                cast, where, etc) but is also interactive with a shifting perspective when the mouse moves, which keeps the audience's 
                                attention. Secondly, I liked the Easygrow app because it combined easily readable visuals with utility. With simple
                                side-to-side swiping, the user can easily find the vegetable they are looking for (aided by both graphics and large text), and once
                                the user has found their vegetable, they can swipe up to access the utlity-oriented pages for notes, graphs, and notifications.
                                Overall, I could see how both designs and user experiences were created with their audience in mind.
