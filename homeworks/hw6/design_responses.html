							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Something I learned from this article is that the speed of animations is dependent on both the animated object and the 
								display method. The graphics were very helpful in seeing the explainations and better undestanding the importance of speed,
								and getting to compare different speeds on different screens or different animation speeds on different parts of the page was
								taught me which types of items (text, list items, large changes, and small items) need to move fast versus which items can 
								move slow. It was also interesting to consider different factors that affect movement, such as collision, overlap, and direction.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this article title "Choreography in interfaces animation". I really enjoyed the graphics in this section,
								which were divided into two parts; the first showed what the different choreographies looked like to the naked eye, and the
								second one slowly traced the line that the animation took to move different objects into position. It was intersting to see how
								slight changes in "choreographies" affected the readability, and I had fun trying to trace out the choreography in the first half
								before checking my understanding against the second half of the animation.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the userâ€™s attention in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another." </p>
