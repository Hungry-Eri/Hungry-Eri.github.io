						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								Something I learned from this article is the way my brain percieves images and visuals. Small things such as the seven
								principles of proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, figure-ground, common-region, and focal points change how I interact
								with and percieve an image. By changing perception (the order of perception, etc) Gestalt's principles change the whole
								image and mood of the design.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the very beginning, with the refence to the cloud. Originally, it was the 
								graphics depicting the priniples, but as I strolled back up and re-read the introduction, I could see what the 
								author meant about the design principles and associations. I particialrly liked this section because it took
								the design principles out of a web-based context and was otherwise intersting.
