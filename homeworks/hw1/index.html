            Hi, I'm Erica! When I have the time, I enjoy painting (usually watercolor) and reading. When I have more than the usuall
            amount of free time (vacation or weekends where procrastination sounds like a better idea than HW) I enjoy skating
            and skiing but can also be convinced to rock climb or swim. If you see me on campus and I walk by without saying hi, it's because
            I have bad eyesight and am likely zoning out; please don't be mad I'm just blind.
        </p>

                Something I learned from this article is that all elements of a page contribute to the readability, from font width to whitespace.
                Elements of a page are chosen based on  a hierarchy that was created around the purpose of the app (intent) and the intendend 
                audience.

                My favoite part of this article was the gif of the app page breakdown because it clearly isolated each of the design elements
                that comprised of a page and made the explainations below it clearer. Also, by bringing in one element at a time, I was
                able to better understand how each element changed the page/the perception of the page.

                "I wonder how many iterations they tried with Dates and Guests only being visible at a later point in the flow... 
                This makes me curious about how people search and when they introduce filters to their searches."

                8!! It was interesting and put to clearer words ideas that I had known beforehand.
