				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I didn't know about dark patterns until this article, so it was interesting to think about how design can be used with 
							less-than scrupulous intentions. The examples on bait-and-switch and the credit card statement was eye-opening, and made 
							me think more about how common dark pattern designs are. On the other hand, misdirection and roach-motel were things I 
							definely knew of beforehand, but reading this article taught me it was a design choice. 
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was the secific examples with images. For example, in the skype-misdirection example,
							I got to see how the graphics drew attention away from what the text explained was happening. And although I knew it was 
							a dark pattern, it was difficult to look at that innocuous image and try to correlate that to the changes the update made
							to your search engine. 
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "manipulation is an experience crafted to change behavior and hence offered designers the ‘Manipulation Matrix’. This matrix, 
							however does not try to answer which businesses are moral or which will succeed. It just seeks to help the innovator/designer 
							answer, “Should I attempt to hook my user?”"</p>
					</li>
