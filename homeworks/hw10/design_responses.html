							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> The article is interesting because it covers the attention span of visual interest and how aspects of a page compete for it.
								The paragraph on spacial versus feature based attenion made me think about the elements I want to include on a page and made me 
								rethink the layout for my final project so it isn't so center-oriented. My favorite examples from the text was the sustained attention
								because the area of my project that I changed was the repetitive formating of all my pages. I had it so that all of my 
								pages looked identical with different subjects on each page, but I am now considering creating sepearte layouts to make things 
								less reptetive to hold attention when the user clicks to a new page.
