							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is the consideration that goes into choosing the ratio between different 
							font categories. The examples about different combinations of relative font scale was really interesting 
							because small differences changed the readability and feeling of the website. The golden ratio example was also
							interesting because my most common complaint when using text types on google docs is the difficulty 
							differentiating between subheading3 and subheading4, but I've never thought about the scaling until this article 
							pointed it out. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the section on font pairing because I've always relied on templates 
								to pair fonts. This has resulted all of my presentations looking repetitive since I have certain templates
								that I re-use constantly, and adding different font pairings into posters and presentations would definelty 
								improve my range of designs. The recommendationed sites to help choose font pairings are something I will 
								definelty take advantage of in the future. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "some fonts are more appropriate for children. When learning to read, children need highly legible fonts 
								with generous letter shapes. A good example of this is Sassoon Primary. Sassoon Primary was developed by 
								Rosemary Sassoon and based on her research into what kind of letters children found easy to read" </p>
